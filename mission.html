The mission is to relentlessly do everything in my power to get the Message out there. I am looking to find allies, I am looking to find happiness, and I am looking for the independence that I need. I will only work on the Mission. Soon, I will choose to quit my job and continue spreading the message through my software as tools, my pictures as reminders, and my words as the message itself. Everything I do is in accordance with the Mission. I will do that which makes me happy. I will engage with others on a deep level. I will forever leave the superficial world and join the one in which I belong. Throughout this life and the many that I have had before, I have been given everything I need in order to reach my highest level of development in order to reach others in the most effective way possible. From now on, every social encounter in which I find myself, it will be deeply filled with meaning and all parties involved will benefit. I need to do what I came here to do, and now I am officially ready to start the LightWork. The foundation has been set. It's time to act. Solely good intentions from now on. I can create the life that I desire.
