# HTML5-Boilerplate-Sass

HTML5 Boilerplate Sass is a simple HTML5 Boilerplate App that includes Sass (and optionally Bootstrap 4) to get simple Web Apps off the ground quickly.

It uses Webpack and Node, so you get all that sweet auto dependency management and Livereload :D

This project is based on https://github.com/Dugnist/html5-boilerplate

## Get started

```
  git clone https://github.com/kLOsk/html5-boilerplate-sass.git my_project
  cd my_project
  npm install
```

Edit files in /src folder

To run the development version with live reload, etc:

```
  npm run watch
```

To run the production build:

```
  npm run build
```

Copy the content of /build to your production server for production deployment.

## OPTIONAL

You can add Bootstrap 4 by running:

```
  npm install jquery popper.js bootstrap
```

Make sure to uncomment the loaders in app.js and style.scss. Bootstrap4 is then ready to go!
